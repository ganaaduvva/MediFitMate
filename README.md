## Docker MCP Gateway Usage

The MCP Gateway enables MediFitMate to interact seamlessly with multiple AI models and tools. It is deployed as a Docker container configured with a custom `catalog.yaml` file describing the available MCP servers and tools.

Key points:

- **Custom Catalog:** The catalog specifies your medical MCP server (`medical-mcp`), its tools (e.g., drug info, health statistics, and literature search), and their endpoints.
- **Flexible Transport:** Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for event-driven communication between the gateway and MCP servers.
- **Docker Compose Integration:** The MCP Gateway container depends on the `medical-mcp` service and shares a user-defined bridge network, allowing smooth inter-container communication.

Example snippet from the Custom Catalog:

## Cerebras Inference and Llama Models

- **Cerebras Model:** The backend uses Cerebras' `CerebrasLiteLlm` to run highly optimized inference on large language models. This accelerates response time and enables the handling of complex medical and fitness queries.
  
- **Llama Models:** The conversational agent is based on Llama models (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-001` or similar) to deliver natural, context-aware dialogue, enhancing user interactions.

These models are loaded and utilized through an async lifespan context to optimize resource consumption and startup performance.

---

## Google AI Developer Kit (Google ADK) Usage

MediFitMate leverages Google ADK's advanced agent framework for building interactive bots with:

- **LlmAgent:** The central conversational agent managing dialogue, tool invocation, and response generation.
- **MCPToolset:** Provides abstraction to interact with the Medical MCP server‚Äôs multiple medical tools seamlessly.
- **Session Management:** Using `InMemorySessionService` to maintain user sessions and conversation states.
- **Runner and Message Handling:** Coordinates asynchronous execution of agent tasks, streaming responses back to the client.

All components combine to provide robust, modular, and scalable AI-powered assistance.

---

## Twilio WhatsApp Integration

- **Twilio API** is used to bridge WhatsApp messages between users and the MediFitMate backend.
- MediFitMate receives incoming WhatsApp messages through Twilio webhooks.
- Outgoing messages, including AI-generated responses, are sent back to users via Twilio's WhatsApp messaging API.
- This integration enables real-time, reliable communication on a platform popular among the target audience.

Ensure you have configured your Twilio account SID, authentication token, and WhatsApp messaging number securely for proper operation.

---

## FastAPI Backend with Modern Lifespan Event Handling

The backend is built with FastAPI, using the modern recommended `lifespan` async context manager for startup and shutdown handling, including:

- Connecting and initializing MCP toolset during startup.
- Gracefully cleaning up resources and connections on shutdown.

This ensures efficient resource management and clean lifecycle handling.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. **Configure environment variables** like `MCP_GATEWAY_URL`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and model references in an `.env` file.
3. **Run** the entire stack using `docker-compose up --build`.
4. **Interact** with MediFitMate via WhatsApp using your configured Twilio WhatsApp phone number.

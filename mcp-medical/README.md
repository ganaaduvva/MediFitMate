# Medical MCP Server

[![Trust Score](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/api/badge/quality/JamesANZ/medical-mcp)](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/jamesanz__medical-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive medical information by querying multiple authoritative medical APIs including FDA, WHO, PubMed, and RxNorm.

## üîí Security Features

**Localhost-Only Binding**: This server is configured for maximum security with localhost-only access:

- **Stdio Mode (Default)**: Inherently localhost-only process communication
- **HTTP Mode**: Binds to `127.0.0.1` only, blocks all external connections
- **IP Filtering**: Validates all incoming connections against localhost addresses
- **CORS Restrictions**: Only allows localhost origins
- **Security Logging**: All blocked connection attempts are logged

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security configuration.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JamesANZ/medical-mcp.git
cd medical-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build
```

#### **2. Configure Claude Desktop**

Create or edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "medical-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/medical-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/medical-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace the paths with your actual installation directory:**

**For users with NVM (Node Version Manager):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "medical-mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/yourusername/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.0/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/yourusername/Documents/projects/medical-mcp/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**For users with system Node.js:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "medical-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourusername/medical-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/Users/yourusername/medical-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**To find your Node.js path:**

```bash
# If using NVM
which node
# Example output: /Users/yourusername/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.0/bin/node

# If using system Node.js
which node
# Example output: /usr/local/bin/node
```

## üîí Security Verification

### **Test Localhost Access**

```bash
# Should work (localhost)
curl http://localhost:3000/info

# Should be blocked (external IP)
curl http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP:3000/info
# Returns: "Access denied: This server is restricted to localhost only"
```

### **Check Binding**

```bash
# Verify server is bound to localhost only
netstat -an | grep :3000
# Should show: 127.0.0.1:3000 (not 0.0.0.0:3000)
